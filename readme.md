Basic Neural Network Example 
============================

This project shows how to use mxnet to train a neural network, using the MNIST training set, to recognize numbers

This has been tested on linux, using the CPU version of mxnet

## Dependencies

Linux packages:

- Python 2.7
- PIP for Python 2.7
- Python-TK (python ui library for using TK)

Python packages:

- mxnet
- pillow

to install these dependencies run: 

    sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-tk

after they have been installed, run the following to install the python packages needed:

    pip install mxnet pillow

## Running

    python number-recognition.py
